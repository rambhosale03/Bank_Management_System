# Bank_Management_System
The Bank Management System is a console-based Java application that simulates basic banking operations. It allows users to manage bank accounts by creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balances.
The system is built using Java classes and interfaces. The Account class stores customer account details, while the RBI interface defines banking operations. The SBI class implements these operations, performing all account-related transactions. The Test class acts as the user interface, providing a menu for users to interact with the system through the console.
